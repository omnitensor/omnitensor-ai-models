## 1. Introduction

OmniTensor provides state-of-the-art AI models for various tasks, including:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Vision models for image classification
- Speech-to-text and text-to-speech models

The models are pre-configured and optimized for use within the OmniTensor ecosystem.

## 2. Setting Up the Environment

To begin using the models, ensure you have the required dependencies installed. These dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file provided in this repository.

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Verify Installation
```bash
python -c "import torch; print('PyTorch installed successfully')"
```

---

## 3. Loading Pre-trained Models

OmniTensor provides an API for loading models. Here's an example of loading a transformer model:

```python
from omnitensor.models.llm.transformer import TransformerModel

# Initialize the model
model = TransformerModel(config_path="model_configs/transformer_config.json")

# Load pre-trained weights
model.load_weights("path/to/weights.bin")
```

### Model Configuration
The `transformer_config.json` file contains parameters for the model architecture. Modify it as needed to customize the model.

---

## 4. Running Inference

Run inference using the loaded model:

```python
# Input prompt
prompt = "What is the capital of France?"

# Get the response
response = model.infer(prompt)
print(f"Model Response: {response}")
```

---

## 5. Fine-tuning Models

OmniTensor models support fine-tuning on custom datasets.

### Example: Fine-tuning a Transformer
```python
from omnitensor.training import Trainer

# Initialize trainer
trainer = Trainer(model, dataset="path/to/dataset", epochs=3, batch_size=16)

# Start fine-tuning
trainer.fine_tune()
```

Ensure your dataset is formatted correctly and matches the model's input requirements.

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Out of Memory Errors**
   - Use smaller batch sizes or reduce the model size in `transformer_config.json`.
2. **Model Initialization Fails**
   - Ensure the paths to configuration and weight files are correct.
